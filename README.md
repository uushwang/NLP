# NLP
The NLP with Disaster Tweets challenge is about identifying which tweets are related to real disaster events. The dataset is sourced from the Crisis Data Portal by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The dataset contains a set of tweets that are labeled as either 'real disaster' or 'not disaster'.
